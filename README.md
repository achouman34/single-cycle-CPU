# single-cycle-CPU
#
# These files contain VHDL entities to synthesize a single-cycle functional CPU using schematic diagrams made in Quartus II. It utilises a  # 8-bit instruction cache, a 5-bit addressable register file, an ALU designed under Harvard architecture, and a 32-bit data cache. The 
# clock frequency of the CPU has been experimentally rated through simulation at 125 MHz.
